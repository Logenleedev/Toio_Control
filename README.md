## Connection Set up
[![Connection-Diagram.png](https://i.postimg.cc/g0WYf2hG/Connection-Diagram.png)](https://postimg.cc/0zVRSxZ4)

## Architecture
The system works as the following steps:
1. Scanner and Bridges connects to Controller.
2. Scanner finds unconnected cube.
3. Scanner tells it to the Controller.
4. Controller finds Bridge which has capacity to connect to the cubes.
5. Controller sends cube address to Bridge to connect it.
6. After the connection is established, Controller can send commands to cubes.

| Cube Controller | Collects information from the Scanner and Bridge and sends out appropriate commands to each cube. | [`14-cubecontroller`](14-cubecontroller)                                       |
| Bridge          | Make a BLE connection with toio cubes and relay with Controller through TCP socket.               | [`13-unitycontroller2/PlatformIO/bridge/`](13-unitycontroller2/PlatformIO/bridge/)   |
| Scanner         | Detects a cube emitting an advertising signal and tells the contoller.                            | [`13-unitycontroller2/PlatformIO/scanner/`](13-unitycontroller2/PlatformIO/scanner/) |

## Installation Instruction
### Upgrade Bootloader thourgh CLI
Go to [Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader Github](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases/tag/0.6.3) and download the latest bootloader

<b>On Linux</b>, install _adafruit-nrfutil_
```
$ pip3 install --user adafruit-nrfutil
```
<b>On mac</b>, if you have pip3 installed, you can use the aforementioned command. Otherwise, you can download the source file [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil/releases/tag/0.5.3.post17)

Plug in nRF52840 board through usb cable. You should able to see the drive on your desktop.

type
```
ls /dev/cu.*
```

You should able to find your board with name (something similar to _/dev/cu.usbmodem411_). This is your board name.

Navigate to the folder where you download adafruit-nrfutil-macos and run adafruit-nrfutil

```
./adafruit-nrfutil-macos --verbose dfu serial --package feather_nrf52840_express_bootloader-0.2.9_s140_6.1.1.zip -p [board name] -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200
```

or 

```
adafruit-nrfutil --verbose dfu serial --package feather_nrf52840_express_bootloader-0.6.3_s140_6.1.1.zip -p [board name] -b 115200 --singlebank --touch 1200
```

Lastly, check the INFO_UF2.TXT file inside your board drive, the version should change from 0.2.x to 0.6.1 or newer.

## Usage Guide
1. Use external power supply to power the bridges and scanner
2. Navigate to ```14-cubecontroller``` folder and run ```RUST_LOG=debug cargo run```
3. The application should work!

## Customize Code
If you want to run this system, you need to change the following parameters:



## Debug Reference

If the system does not work as expected, please check the following:
- Confirm that the bridge modules can connect to the controller.
(Check the bridge and controller logs)
- Confirm that the scanner module can connect to the controller.
(Check the scanner and controller logs.)
- Turn on the cube, then check the scanner logs to see if it detects the cube.
- Scanner will send the detected cubeâ€™s mac address to the controller. So check the log of controller whether received the mac address properly.
